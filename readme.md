Elden Gram Final Project at General Assembly!!!

Live site: https://eldengram.onrender.com

Full Stack Project made with Django and Postgresql.


Elden Gram is a "social Media" platform where elden ring players can share their builds with one another by posting them to the player builds page. This is a very bare bones site as i only had 10 days to develop it. I will be continmuing development in the very near future.

As of right now these are the features: 

Users can view the list of builds and click on any one they choose to bring them to the detail page of that build. From there, they can view the description, levels and all of the items attatched to that character (spells, weapons armor etc.).
from there they can edit them and add or remove any of the items they choose. clicking a dropdown will show you all the items from the catagory to add them to your build, and edit the name, img, or description.


Features that id like to add: 

Auth. users shouldnt be able to edit other users builds.

searchability for the dropdowns to add items.

css rework to make the site mobile friendly and re style everything to make it fit the elden ring style better.
